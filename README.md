# ✂️ Python Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Project Overview

This is a classic, console-based implementation of the **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game. Built entirely in **Python**, the script allows a user to play multiple rounds against a randomized computer opponent. It serves as a clear example of using conditional logic and the `random` module for simple game development.

## ✨ Features

  * **Console-Based Play:** Interactive gameplay within the terminal.
  * **Computer Opponent:** Utilizes the Python `random` module to generate fair, randomized moves.
  * **Input Validation:** Ensures the user only enters valid choices (`rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`).
  * **Replay Option:** Allows the user to easily play multiple rounds without restarting the script.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

  * **Language:** Python
  * **Libraries:** `random` (Standard Library)
